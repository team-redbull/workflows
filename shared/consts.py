# Queue names are scoped differently ON PURPOSE. The ACTIVITY queue belongs to
# the DOMAIN: one activity-worker deployment (`segment-lifecycle-worker`) owns that
# domain's dependency + credential set, and every workflow in the domain routes
# its activities there. Each WORKFLOW gets its OWN workflow queue, so a third
# workflow in this domain (e.g. a future release-segment) registers on its own
# queue while reusing the same limb.
